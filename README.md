# tic-tac-toe

This is my tic tac toe project, where I built a 2 player tic tac toe game played across a 4x4 board. It uses 2 dimensional arrays and employs a top down function
structure. 

It will prompt the users to input their desired turn via numbers on the board and will actively track stats such as wins, ties and losses.

It can be run via any code editor/IDE.
